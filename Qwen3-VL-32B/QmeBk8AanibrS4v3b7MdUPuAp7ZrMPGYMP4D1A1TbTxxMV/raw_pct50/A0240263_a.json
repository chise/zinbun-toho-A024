The content consists of entries for various characters related to the radical '穴' (cave/hole), each with its own definition, phonetic notation (using the fanqie method), and sometimes etymological analysis. The layout includes large seal script forms of the characters on the left, followed by their explanations in smaller regular script. The right margin contains pagination ('小二百六十三') and section information ('言文七下', '魏三')."}
