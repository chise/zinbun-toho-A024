The text is arranged in vertical columns, reading from top to bottom and right to left. Each entry includes a character, its definition, phonetic notation (using '反切' method), and sometimes alternative forms or etymological notes. The characters are written in seal script (篆书) and clerical script (隶书), with explanations in regular script (楷书). The layout is typical of traditional Chinese lexicography."}
