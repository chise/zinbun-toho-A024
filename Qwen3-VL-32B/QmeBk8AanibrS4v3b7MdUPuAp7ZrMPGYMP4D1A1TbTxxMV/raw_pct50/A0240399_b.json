The layout features large **seal script** characters (篆书) in the center, each accompanied by its definition, phonetic notation (using *fanqie* method), and etymological analysis (e.g., '从水', '从土', '从木' meaning 'from water', 'from earth', 'from wood'). The characters are arranged vertically in columns, typical of traditional Chinese books. The left margin contains page numbers ('六三十') and possibly a section marker ('卷之二十二'), while the bottom left corner has the name '蒋安', likely the editor or publisher. The content focuses on characters related to water (氵部), as indicated by the recurring '从水' (from water) in definitions."}
