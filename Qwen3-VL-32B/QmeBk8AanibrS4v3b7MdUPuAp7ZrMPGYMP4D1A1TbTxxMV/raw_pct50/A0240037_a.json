It displays various Chinese characters in seal script (篆书) alongside their phonetic readings (using反切, e.g., '古歷切') and definitions (e.g., '帥也从帥...' meaning 'a character derived from 帥...'). The layout includes columns of characters with annotations to the right. The top-right corner contains page numbering: '小三百十三' (small 300+13), and '言文二' (likely indicating a section on speech/writing). The bottom-right has '陳元', possibly the name of the compiler or publisher."}
