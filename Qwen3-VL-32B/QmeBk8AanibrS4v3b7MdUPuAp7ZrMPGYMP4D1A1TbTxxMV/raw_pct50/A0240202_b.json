Each entry includes the character in seal script, its definition, phonetic transcription (using *fanqie* method), and sometimes etymological notes. The characters are arranged vertically in columns, typical of traditional Chinese book layout. The left margin contains page numbers and possibly volume/section indicators: '大三十三' (Volume 33), '兑下上' (possibly a section marker), and '五' (page 5), along with '表和' at the bottom, which may indicate the name of the compiler or publisher. The content focuses on tree-related characters, as indicated by the frequent use of the radical '木' (wood)."}
