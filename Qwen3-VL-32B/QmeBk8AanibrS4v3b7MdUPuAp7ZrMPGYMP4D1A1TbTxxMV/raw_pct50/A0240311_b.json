The characters are arranged vertically in columns, typical of traditional Chinese printing. The box has a thick black border and appears to be part of a printed classical dictionary or lexicon, possibly from a work like the *Shuowen Jiezi* or similar. On the left margin, there are additional vertical labels such as '大艸' and '唐文', indicating sections or editions."}
