The characters are arranged in columns from right to left, with large seal script (篆书) forms on the left side of each entry and smaller regular script (楷书) explanations and phonetic annotations on the right. The content appears to be entries related to the radical '示' (altar/ritual), including definitions, etymologies, and pronunciation guides using the fanqie method (e.g., '古外切', '古末切')."}
