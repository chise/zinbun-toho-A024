The layout features columns of characters in seal script (篆书) alongside their explanations, including definitions, phonetic readings (using *fanqie* method), and etymological notes. Each entry typically includes the character in seal script, its pronunciation (via *fanqie*), meaning, and sometimes its structural components (radicals and semantic/phonetic elements). The vertical columns are arranged from right to left, as per traditional Chinese book layout. The outer border suggests this is a printed page from an old woodblock-printed book. Marginalia on the left edge includes page numbers or section markers such as '大三十一' and '上五', indicating this is part of a larger volume."}
