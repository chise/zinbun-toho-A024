	{"bbox": [75, 269, 820, 853], "type": "text-box", "comment": "This is a rectangular text box containing classical Chinese characters in seal script (篆书) with accompanying explanations in regular script (楷书). The layout is vertical, typical of traditional Chinese books. The content appears to be from a dictionary or lexicon, possibly a section of the *Shuowen Jiezi* (说文解字), given the structure: each entry includes the character, its pronunciation (via反切, e.g., '聲如乘切'), definition, and etymology ('从手...', meaning 'from hand...'). The right margin contains page numbers and section indicators ('小三六七', '言三二一', '一百', '王必')."}
