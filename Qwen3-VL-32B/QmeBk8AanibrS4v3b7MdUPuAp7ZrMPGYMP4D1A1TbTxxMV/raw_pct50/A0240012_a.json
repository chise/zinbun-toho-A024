	{"bbox": [76, 253, 849, 860], "type": "text-box", "comment": "This is a grid of Chinese characters in seal script (篆书), arranged vertically in columns. Each character is accompanied by its phonetic pronunciation in 'fanqie' (反切) notation below it, which consists of two characters indicating the initial and final sounds. The layout is typical of classical Chinese dictionaries or linguistic texts, such as the *Shuowen Jiezi* or similar works. The outer border is thick and black, and there are marginal annotations on the right side: '小三百' at the top, '王' in the middle, and '初三' at the bottom — likely page or section identifiers. The paper appears aged, with slight discoloration and wear along the edges."}
