The layout features large seal script characters in the center with smaller explanatory texts in regular script to their right and below. The content includes definitions, phonetic annotations (using '切' — 'qie' — for pronunciation), and etymological explanations (e.g., '从鬥' meaning 'composed of the radical 鬥'). The heading '文八 重一' suggests this is part of a section listing eight primary characters, with this being the first sub-section ('重一'). The left margin contains vertical text indicating volume/page information: '大十五', '兑下二', '表和'. The overall style is characteristic of classical Chinese lexicography from the Ming or Qing dynasties."}
