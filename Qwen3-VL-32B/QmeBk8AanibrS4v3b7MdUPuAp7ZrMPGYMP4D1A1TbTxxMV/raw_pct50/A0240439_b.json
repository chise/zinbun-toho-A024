The layout features large characters in seal script (篆书) on the left side of each entry, with corresponding explanations and phonetic annotations in regular script (楷书) to their right. Each entry includes the character's meaning, its phonetic pronunciation (using fanqie method, e.g., '从女敷声' — ‘from 女, sound of 敷’), and sometimes etymological notes. The content focuses on female-related characters (all entries begin with the radical '女'). The vertical column on the far left contains marginalia including section numbers ('六寸二', '兑之十二') and possibly the name of the compiler or editor ('陈玉'). The black border frames the main text block."}
