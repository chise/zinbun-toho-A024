The layout includes small seal script characters (篆书) on the left of each entry, followed by explanations in regular script (楷书). Each entry provides etymological analysis (e.g., '从鳥' meaning 'composed of 鳥'), pronunciation via fanqie (e.g., '乙兾切'), and definitions. The right margin contains page numbers ('小三百十八', '十九', '祁三') and possibly section indicators ('言文四')."}
