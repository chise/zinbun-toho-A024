The text includes small seal script (小篆) characters alongside their definitions, phonetic annotations (e.g., '切' for pronunciation), and etymological explanations. The layout is traditional, with characters arranged vertically from right to left. The outer border is thick and black, framing the content. On the right edge, there are page numbers or section markers ('小三百六十六', '言文二一', '一六一', '祁三')."}
