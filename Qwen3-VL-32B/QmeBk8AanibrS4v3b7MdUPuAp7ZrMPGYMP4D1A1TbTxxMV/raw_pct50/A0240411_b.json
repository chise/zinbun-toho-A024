It contains entries for various fish-related characters (all with the radical 魚, meaning 'fish'), presented in vertical columns. Each entry includes: \n\n- The character in seal script (smaller, stylized form at the top of each column).\n- The character in regular script (larger, standard form below the seal script).\n- A definition or explanation (e.g., \"魚名\" meaning \"a name of a fish\", or descriptions like \"狀似蝦無足長寸大如乂\").\n- Phonetic information (e.g., \"聲七接切\", indicating pronunciation via reverse cut method).\n- Etymological notes (e.g., \"从魚某聲\", meaning \"composed of the fish radical and the phonetic component 某\").\n- References to regions or sources (e.g., \"出樂浪潘國\", meaning \"comes from the country of Lelang Pan\").\n\nThe left margin includes annotations such as \"大廿八\" (possibly a section number), \"兑之二下\" (perhaps a chapter or subsection identifier), and \"唐文\" (indicating Tang dynasty script or style). The layout is typical of traditional Chinese dictionaries, with black ink on aged paper, framed by a thick border."}
