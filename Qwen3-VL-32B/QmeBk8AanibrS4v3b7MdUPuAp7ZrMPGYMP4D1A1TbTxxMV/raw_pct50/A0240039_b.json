The layout includes small seal script characters (篆书) on the left side of each entry, followed by explanations in regular script (楷书). Each entry provides the character's meaning, phonetic pronunciation (using反切, i.e., fanqie method), and sometimes etymological or structural analysis (e.g., '从艸' meaning 'composed with the radical 艹'). The text is arranged vertically from right to left, consistent with traditional Chinese printing. The outer black border frames the main content area. On the far left margin, there are vertical annotations including page numbers ('大三百四') and possibly section markers ('兑之下')."}
