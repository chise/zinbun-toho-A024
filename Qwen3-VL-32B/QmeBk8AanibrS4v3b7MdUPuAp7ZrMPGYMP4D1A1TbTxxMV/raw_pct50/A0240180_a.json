The text is arranged in vertical columns from right to left, typical of traditional Chinese printing. It includes entries such as '血' (xuè), '文十五', '重三', etc., suggesting this is a page from a classical dictionary or lexicographical work like the *Shuowen Jiezi*. The layout features large characters with smaller explanatory text beside them, and some sections are marked with '文' (number of characters) and '重' (repeated or compound characters)."}
