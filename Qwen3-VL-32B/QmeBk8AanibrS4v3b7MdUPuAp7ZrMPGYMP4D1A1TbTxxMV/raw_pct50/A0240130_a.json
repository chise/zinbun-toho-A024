The content is organized in columns with entries for characters related to '羽' (feather). Each entry includes the character in seal script, its definition, phonetic notation (using fanqie), and etymological analysis (often using the 'from...sound...' structure). The right-hand margin contains page numbers ('小二百十七') and other annotations ('言文四一', '景高')."}
