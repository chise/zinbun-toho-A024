The layout includes large characters (likely seal script) on the left with corresponding explanations in smaller regular script to their right. The central column contains the heading '文五十三 重四', indicating this is the 53rd section of characters, with four additional (repeated or supplementary) entries. Each entry provides the character, its meaning, phonetic information (via '切' — cutting/phonetic notation), and etymological structure ('从山...' — composed of mountain radical plus other components). The vertical margin on the left includes pagination and possibly the book's title or section marker ('大二十二', '说文下', '三', '程樹')."}
