The text includes entries like '文二十八 重十六' and definitions for characters such as '度', '友', and '卩'. It appears to be a page from a classical Chinese dictionary or lexicographical work, possibly the *Shuowen Jiezi*. The layout features large seal script characters on the left with smaller clerical script explanations to their right. The margin contains vertical text including '大十八' and '表和'. The entire block is enclosed by a thick black border."}
