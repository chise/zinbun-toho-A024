It contains large seal script characters (篆书) in the center, with smaller regular script (楷书) explanations to their right. Each entry includes the character, its pronunciation (in fanqie notation), etymology, and definitions. The layout is traditional, with vertical columns read from top to bottom, right to left. The black border frames the main content, and there are marginal annotations on the left edge, including what appears to be a volume/section marker (\"大字\", \"兌下三上\") and a name (\"陳玉\")."}
