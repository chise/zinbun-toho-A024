It contains entries for various Chinese characters, each with their seal script form, phonetic transcription (using *fanqie* method), meaning, and etymological analysis (often using the 'from X' structure). The characters are arranged vertically in columns, typical of traditional Chinese printing. The left margin includes page numbers ('大三十二') and possibly author or source notes ('張信')."}
