This appears to be a page from a classical Chinese dictionary or lexicon, possibly the *Shuowen Jiezi*, with entries for rain-related characters (all beginning with '雨' radical). The right margin contains smaller annotations including '小言等', '言文十二', and '李云'. The entire text area is framed by a thick black border."}
