The main content is organized in columns, with each entry showing a Chinese character (often in seal script), its definition, phonetic notation (using *fanqie* method), and etymological analysis (e.g., '从立' meaning 'from 立'). The large heading on the right reads: '立之屬皆从立 力入切', meaning 'All characters belonging to the category of 立 are derived from 立; pronounced like 力入'. The right margin contains vertical text: '小篆文二一 洪章', indicating this is page 21 of small seal script characters, possibly from a volume by Hong Zhang. The layout is typical of classical Chinese lexicography."}
