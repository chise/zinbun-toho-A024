	{"bbox": [84, 250, 819, 852], "type": "text-box", "comment": "This is a rectangular text box containing ancient Chinese characters, likely from a classical dictionary or lexicon (such as *Shuowen Jiezi*). The text is arranged in vertical columns, reading from right to left. Each entry includes a character in seal script, followed by its definition, phonetic transcription (using *fanqie* method), and etymological analysis (e.g., '从风' meaning 'from the radical 风'). The box is bordered with thick black ink lines, showing signs of wear or printing imperfections at the edges. On the right margin, there are page numbers or section markers: '小豆六十二', '彭三十三', '三', and '陳元'. At the bottom-left, the label '文三 附新風東南日音' appears, possibly indicating a section or appendix. The content focuses on wind-related characters ('风' as the radical)."}
