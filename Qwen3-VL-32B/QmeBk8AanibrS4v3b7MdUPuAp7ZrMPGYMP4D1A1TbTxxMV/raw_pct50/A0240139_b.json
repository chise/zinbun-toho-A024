The characters are arranged in columns, with large seal script (篆书) characters on the left side of each entry, followed by smaller explanatory text in regular script (楷书). The content appears to be definitions or etymologies of bird-related characters, as indicated by the repeated use of the '鳥' radical and terms like '鴛鴦', '鷹', '鶴', etc. The page number '大三十六' is visible at the top left, and '張信' is noted at the bottom left, possibly indicating the editor or scribe."}
