The layout includes large characters with their meanings, phonetic annotations (using the 'fanqie' method), and etymological explanations (often including radical components). The text is arranged vertically from right to left, as per traditional Chinese printing conventions.\n\nKey features:\n- **Large Characters**: Each character is displayed prominently on the left side of its entry.\n- **Definitions and Etymology**: To the right of each character, there are definitions and explanations, often indicating the meaning, phonetic component, and semantic radical.\n- **Phonetic Annotations**: Words like “胡計切” (hú jì qiè) or “居奄切” (jū yǎn qiè) indicate pronunciation via the fanqie system.\n- **Radical Indication**: Phrases such as “从目” (from eye radical) show the semantic component.\n- **Page Header**: The top right corner has “小三百十二” (small 3012) and “說文四上” (Shuowen Volume 4, Upper), indicating this is part of a larger work.\n- **Centered Text**: “文百十三 重九” (Text 113, Repeated 9) likely refers to the number of characters in this section and possibly a repetition count for learning or printing.\n- **Author/Editor Note**: “楊永” (Yang Yong) appears at the bottom right, possibly the name of the editor or publisher.\n\nThe characters shown include: 目 (eye), 瞼 (eyelid), 睨 (to glance sideways), 瞬 (to blink), 眈 (to stare), 省 (to inspect), etc., all related to the eye or vision — consistent with being part of a section devoted to the “目” radical."}
