The layout features large, stylized characters (likely seal script) on the left side of each entry, with smaller regular script explanations to their right. The content includes definitions, phonetic annotations (using *fanqie* method), etymological breakdowns (e.g., '从马', meaning 'from 马'), and references to classical texts like the *Poetry Classic* ('诗'). The vertical column on the far left contains page numbers ('六十八') and section headings ('说文下上'), indicating this is part of a larger work. The overall format is typical of traditional Chinese lexicography."}
