The text appears to be from a classical Chinese dictionary or lexicographical work, possibly a version of the *Shuowen Jiezi* or similar. The layout includes large characters (likely seal script) on the left, followed by smaller explanatory text in regular script. The top right corner has a label: '小徐本 言文九' (indicating this is from the 'Small Xu' edition, section 'Yan Wen Nine')."}
