The text appears to be a list of corrections or annotations, possibly from an ancient manuscript or printed book, with references to specific leaves (葉) and lines (行). It includes instructions such as '改' (change), '增' (add), and mentions of characters like '壇', '萬', '門', etc. The layout is traditional, with black ink on aged paper, enclosed by a thick border. There are marginal notes on the left edge, including what seems to be a name '陳賡' at the bottom."}
