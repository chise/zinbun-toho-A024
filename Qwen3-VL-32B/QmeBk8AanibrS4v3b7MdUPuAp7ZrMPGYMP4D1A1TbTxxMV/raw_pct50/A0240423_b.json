Each character is accompanied by its definition or explanation in smaller regular script, including phonetic annotations (e.g., '切', '聲'). The box has a thick black border and appears to be from a classical Chinese dictionary or lexicographical work. On the left margin, there are additional vertical annotations such as '大廿' and '丁山'. The content seems to be entries for hand-related characters (many with the radical '手'), consistent with traditional Chinese character dictionaries like the *Shuowen Jiezi*. The layout suggests a printed page from an old book, possibly woodblock-printed."}
