The characters are arranged in traditional right-to-left, top-to-bottom format, with small annotations (e.g., phonetic readings like '切', '聲') next to each character. The layout includes large, bold characters (likely the main entries) followed by smaller explanatory text. A thick black border frames the entire text area."}
