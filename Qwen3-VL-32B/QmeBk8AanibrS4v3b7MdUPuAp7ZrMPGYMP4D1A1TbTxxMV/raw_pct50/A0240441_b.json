	{"bbox": [175, 246, 938, 853], "type": "text-box", "comment": "This is a rectangular text block containing Chinese characters in a traditional vertical layout. The text appears to be from a classical dictionary or lexicon (possibly *Shuowen Jiezi* or similar), with each entry including a character, its definition, phonetic notation (e.g., '切' for pronunciation), and etymological information (e.g., '从女' meaning 'from 女'). The characters are written in a clear, formal script, likely seal script or a stylized version of it, within a bordered frame. The left margin contains column headers such as '大十七', '说文十二下', and '袁和', indicating section numbers and possibly the name of the editor or publisher."}
