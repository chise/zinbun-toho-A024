The layout includes small seal script characters on the left, followed by explanations in regular script (楷书) to the right. Each entry provides the character, its phonetic pronunciation (using *fanqie* method), etymology, and definitions. The central column states '文二百四十八 重三十一', meaning '248 original characters, 31 repeated (or derived) characters'. The vertical text along the left margin indicates the section ('大廿二' = 'Great Section 22') and possibly the publisher or editor ('袁和')."}
