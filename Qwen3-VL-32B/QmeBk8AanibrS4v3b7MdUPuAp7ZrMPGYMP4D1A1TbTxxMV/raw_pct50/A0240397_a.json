The text contains Chinese characters in seal script (篆书) alongside their explanations, phonetic readings (using fanqie method), and etymological components. The right margin indicates \"小徐本 說文十二上\" (Xiao Xu edition, Shuowen, Volume 12, Part 1) and \"洪章\", suggesting this is a specific edition or copy of the text. The main body consists of columns of characters with definitions, such as '湖' meaning 'a lake', '渾' meaning 'mixed, turbid', etc., each accompanied by its structure (e.g., '从水...' meaning 'composed of water radical...') and pronunciation."}
