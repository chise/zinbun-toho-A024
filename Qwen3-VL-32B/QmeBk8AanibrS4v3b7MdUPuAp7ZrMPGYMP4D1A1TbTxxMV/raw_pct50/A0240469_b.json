The layout includes small seal script characters (篆书) on the left side of each entry, followed by explanations in regular script (楷书). The entries are arranged vertically, with definitions including phonetic notation (e.g., '切' for cutting/indicating pronunciation), semantic components ('从虫' meaning 'from insect'), and etymological notes. The central column contains the count: '文一百五十三 重十五', meaning '153 unique characters, 15 repeated ones'. The left margin includes page numbers ('六十六') and other editorial annotations ('兑文下三上', '蒋安')."}
