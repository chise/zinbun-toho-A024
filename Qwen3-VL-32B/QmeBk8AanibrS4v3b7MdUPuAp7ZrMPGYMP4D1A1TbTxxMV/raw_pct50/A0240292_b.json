It contains entries for various clothing-related characters, each with its seal script form, definition, phonetic notation (using fanqie), and sometimes etymological notes. The layout is traditional: large seal script characters are on the left, followed by smaller regular script explanations to their right. The vertical column on the far left includes page numbers ('大二十八', '兑六八十二') and possibly the name of the compiler or editor ('程高')."}
