The text is arranged in vertical columns from right to left, typical of traditional Chinese books. Each entry includes the character, its etymology (often with components like '从木' meaning 'from wood'), pronunciation via *fanqie* (e.g., '吉剴切'), and definition. The characters are presented in both large seal script and smaller regular script for explanation. The black border frames the main content area. There is visible wear along the right edge, suggesting an old printed book."}
