It contains entries for various water-related characters (all with the radical 水 'water'), each accompanied by its small seal script form, definition, phonetic notation (using the fanqie method), and etymological explanation. The layout is vertical, traditional Chinese format, with characters arranged in columns from right to left. The thick black border frames the main content area."}
