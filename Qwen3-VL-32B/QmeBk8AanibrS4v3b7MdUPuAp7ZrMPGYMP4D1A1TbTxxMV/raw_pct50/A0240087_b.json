The layout features large characters in seal script (篆书) on the left side of each entry, with smaller accompanying explanations in regular script (楷书) to the right. Each entry includes the character, its definition, phonetic notation (using '切' — cutting/phonetic indicator), and etymological analysis (e.g., '从言...' meaning 'composed of 言...'). The vertical column on the far left contains page or section markers ('大卅五', '兑文三上', '五', '六'), indicating this is part of a larger volume. The black border frames the main content area."}
