The layout includes large characters on the left with their ancient forms (e.g., seal script), followed by definitions, phonetic readings (using fanqie method), and etymological notes. The text is arranged in vertical columns from right to left, typical of traditional Chinese printing. The rightmost column contains the heading '小三日九二 言文巴一' and '嚴華', indicating a section number and possibly the name of the publisher or editor."}
