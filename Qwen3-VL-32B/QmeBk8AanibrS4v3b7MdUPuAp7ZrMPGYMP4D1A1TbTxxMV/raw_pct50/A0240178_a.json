	{"bbox": [64, 250, 839, 858], "type": "text-box", "comment": "This is a page from a classical Chinese dictionary or lexicographical text, likely a version of the *Shuowen Jiezi* (说文解字) or a similar work. The text is arranged in vertical columns, written from top to bottom and right to left, as traditional Chinese texts are. Each entry includes a character in seal script (篆书), followed by its definition, etymology, and pronunciation (using the fanqie method). The characters shown are all related to the radical '皿' (a vessel or container), which is evident from the recurring component in many of the characters. The rightmost column contains annotations such as '小篆' (small seal script), '說文三上' (Shuowen, Volume 3, Upper), and '李云' (Li Yun), indicating the source and possibly a commentator. The page shows signs of age, with slight discoloration and wear along the edges."}
