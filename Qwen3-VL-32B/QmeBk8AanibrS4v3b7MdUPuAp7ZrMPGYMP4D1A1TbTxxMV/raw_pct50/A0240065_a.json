The text is arranged in columns with large characters on the left (likely the main entries) and smaller explanatory text to their right. Each entry includes the character, its pronunciation (in fanqie notation), etymology (e.g., '从走某声'), and definitions. The characters are written in seal script (篆书) for the main entries, with explanations in clerical or regular script. The page number '小三音九十三' appears at the top right, indicating a section or volume number. There is also a name '李明' at the bottom right, possibly the scribe or editor."}
