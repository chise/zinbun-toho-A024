It presents characters in seal script (篆书) with explanations in small regular script (楷书). The main heading reads '屬皆从勹' (All these characters are derived from the radical 勹), indicating this section groups characters sharing the '勹' radical. Each entry includes: the character in seal script, its pronunciation (in fanqie, e.g., '布交切'), definition, and etymological analysis (e.g., '从勹二', '从勹九聲'). The layout is grid-based, with columns of characters and their descriptions. The left margin contains page numbers ('六十八', '上三') and possibly the name of the source ('唐文')."}
