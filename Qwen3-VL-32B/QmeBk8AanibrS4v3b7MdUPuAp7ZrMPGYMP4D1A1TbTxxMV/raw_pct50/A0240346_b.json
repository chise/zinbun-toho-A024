The layout includes large seal script (小篆) characters on the left side of each entry, with smaller regular script (楷书) annotations to their right, explaining the character’s meaning, phonetic component, and etymology. The entries are arranged vertically in columns, typical of traditional Chinese book formatting. The marginalia on the left edge includes page numbers and possibly section titles (e.g., '大廿九', '兑下上', '陈玉')."}
