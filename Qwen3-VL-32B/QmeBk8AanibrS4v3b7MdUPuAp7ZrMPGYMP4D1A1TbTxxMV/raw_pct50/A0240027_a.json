The layout includes large seal script (篆书) characters on the left, with smaller regular script (楷书) explanations to their right. Each entry provides etymological analysis, including components (e.g., '从玉' meaning 'from jade'), phonetic indicators ('声'), definitions, and sometimes references to classical texts like the *Rites of Zhou* (周礼). The characters discussed are mostly related to jade (玉), such as 璋, 琮, 璧, etc., indicating this section focuses on jade artifacts and their symbolic uses in ancient rituals. The top-right corner indicates the page number: 小四百十七 (small 417), and the side column reads 說文一上 (Shuowen Volume 1, Upper), confirming its source. The overall content is scholarly, aimed at explaining character structure and historical usage."}
