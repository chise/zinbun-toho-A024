The content consists of entries for water-related characters (all with the radical 氵 or 水), presented in traditional vertical columns from right to left. Each entry includes the character in seal script (篆书), its definition, phonetic notation (using the *fanqie* system), and sometimes etymological notes. The layout is typical of ancient Chinese lexicography: each column contains one character followed by its explanation. The page number \"廿六\" (twenty-six) and the name \"洪章\" are visible on the right margin. The paper shows signs of age, with slight discoloration and wear along the edges."}
