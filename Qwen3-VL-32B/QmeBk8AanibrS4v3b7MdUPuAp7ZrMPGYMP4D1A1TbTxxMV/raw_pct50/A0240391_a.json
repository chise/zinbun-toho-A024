The layout features large **seal script** characters on the left side of each entry, with smaller **regular script** explanations to their right. Each entry includes definitions, phonetic readings (using *fanqie* method), and etymological notes (e.g., '从水' meaning 'from water', indicating the radical). The entries are arranged vertically in columns, typical of traditional Chinese book layouts. The top-right corner contains pagination or section markers: '小中00二' and '說文十三'. The right margin also has a vertical column with '王必' — possibly a name or annotation. The overall content focuses on water-related characters (all contain the '氵' radical), such as 淀, 深, 清, 濾, etc."}
