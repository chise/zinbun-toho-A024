The layout includes large characters in seal script on the left, followed by explanations in regular script, including phonetic annotations (e.g., '先稽切'), definitions, and etymological notes. The text discusses the character '至' (to arrive) and related forms, with references to classical texts like the *Book of Zhou* (周书). The right margin contains page numbers ('小二十', '言又一二一') and possibly a name ('洪章')."}
