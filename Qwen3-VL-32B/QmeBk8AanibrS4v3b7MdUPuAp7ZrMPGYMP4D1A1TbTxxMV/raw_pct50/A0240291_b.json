The content is organized in columns, with large characters on the left (likely the main character being defined) followed by smaller explanatory text including definitions, etymologies, phonetic readings (in *fanqie* notation), and sometimes alternative forms or related characters. The layout includes both seal script (篆书) and regular script (楷书). The heading at the top right reads: “形凡衣之屬皆从衣” — meaning 'All characters related to clothing are derived from the radical 衣'. This indicates the section is devoted to characters with the '衣' (clothing) radical. The vertical margin on the left contains page numbers or section markers: ‘大二十八’ (Da Erba, possibly meaning Volume 2, Page 28), ‘兑下八十二’ (Dui Xia Baershi'er), and ‘程高’ (Cheng Gao), which may be the name of the editor or publisher. The black border frames the text block, typical of traditional Chinese printed books."}
