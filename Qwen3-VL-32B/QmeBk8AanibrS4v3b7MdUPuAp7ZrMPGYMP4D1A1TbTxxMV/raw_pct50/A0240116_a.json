The characters are arranged in columns, with each entry including a large character (possibly in seal script), followed by smaller explanatory text in regular script, including phonetic annotations (e.g., '切', '聲') and etymological descriptions ('从支', '从貝'). The right edge of the box has a vertical column of smaller text, possibly page numbers or section headers ('小言十三', '十三', '李云')."}
