The characters are presented in a vertical layout, with large seal script (篆书) forms on the left and smaller regular script (楷书) annotations to their right. Each entry includes the character, its definition, phonetic notation (using *fanqie*), and sometimes etymological or structural analysis (e.g., '从火' meaning 'from fire', indicating the radical). The content focuses on characters related to fire (火部). The margins contain additional information: on the left margin, '大荒' (possibly a section title), '兑下二十二' (likely a page or chapter number), and '丁山' (perhaps a name or identifier)."}
