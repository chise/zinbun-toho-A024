The layout includes large seal script (小篆) characters on the left side of each entry, followed by their definitions, phonetic annotations (using *fanqie*), and etymological explanations in regular script. The entries are organized vertically in columns, with each column containing multiple characters related to the semantic category of '馬' (horse). The right margin contains vertical labels such as '小刀口', '言文一', '二', and '李云', which may indicate section or page identifiers. The overall format suggests an ancient printed edition, possibly woodblock-printed, given the ink bleed and paper texture."}
