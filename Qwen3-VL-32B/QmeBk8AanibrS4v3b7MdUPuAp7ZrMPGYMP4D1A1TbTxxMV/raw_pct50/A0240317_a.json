It displays characters in seal script (小篆) along with their definitions, phonetic readings (using *fanqie* method), and etymological explanations. The layout is vertical, with each entry containing the character, its meaning, pronunciation, and sometimes structural analysis (e.g., '从彡' meaning 'composed of the radical 彡'). The right margin includes annotations such as '小言三十二' and '王必', possibly indicating section number or compiler/editor."}
