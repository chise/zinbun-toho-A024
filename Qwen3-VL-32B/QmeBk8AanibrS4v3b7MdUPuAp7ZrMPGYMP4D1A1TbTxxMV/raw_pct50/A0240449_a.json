The layout includes large seal script characters, followed by their explanations in smaller regular script, including definitions, phonetic information (using *fanqie* method), and etymological notes. The content here focuses on characters related to '曲' (qū, meaning 'bent' or 'curved'), with entries such as '匚' (a container-like shape), '曲' itself, and its variants or related characters like '匜', '圂', '単', etc. The text also includes structural analysis (e.g., '从匚甲聲') and references to classical texts (e.g., '周禮曰祭祀')."}
