	{"bbox": [79, 256, 830, 849], "type": "text-box", "comment": "This is a rectangular text box containing Chinese characters in traditional vertical columns, likely from an ancient dictionary or classical text. The characters are written in black ink on a light background, enclosed by a thick black border. The text includes both regular script and seal script forms, with annotations such as phonetic readings (e.g., '切') and etymological explanations (e.g., '从女...'). The layout is consistent with historical Chinese lexicography, possibly from a work like the *Shuowen Jiezi*. The right margin contains smaller text indicating page number ('小三九五') and section ('言文十三'), along with a name ('宏昌') at the bottom right, likely the publisher or editor."}
