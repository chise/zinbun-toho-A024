The layout includes small seal script characters (篆书) on the left, followed by their definitions, phonetic annotations (using the 'fanqie' method), and sometimes alternative forms or related characters. The right-hand side contains vertical column headers such as '小口口口', '言文五上', '三', and '洪帝', which may indicate section or volume numbers. The content focuses on bamboo-related characters (竹部), as indicated by the repeated use of the radical '竹' (bamboo)."}
