The layout includes large characters in seal script (篆书) on the left side of each entry, followed by explanations in regular script (楷书) to the right. The content provides definitions, etymologies, phonetic readings (using *fanqie* method), and sometimes historical or geographical context for each character. The vertical columns are typical of traditional Chinese book printing. The page number \"一五\" (15) appears at the bottom left, and there is a marginal note \"太二十八 兒之下\" indicating its position within the larger work."}
