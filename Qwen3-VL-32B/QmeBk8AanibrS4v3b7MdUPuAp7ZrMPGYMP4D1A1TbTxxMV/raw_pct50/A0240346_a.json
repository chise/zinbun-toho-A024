The text is arranged in vertical columns, written in traditional Chinese characters. It contains entries for various characters related to deer (鹿), including their definitions, phonetic readings (via '切' - cutting/phonetic notation), and etymological explanations (e.g., '从鹿' meaning 'derived from 鹿'). Each entry includes the character itself, its definition, and sometimes an explanation of its structure (e.g., '象頭角四足之形' — 'resembles the head, horns, and four feet of a form'). The right-hand margin includes annotations such as '小豆十三' and '言文十一', which may indicate section or chapter numbers. The overall layout and style are characteristic of early printed editions of classical Chinese texts."}
