Contains Chinese characters with annotations (e.g., '文百十六', '重十九', '新附'), likely from a classical dictionary or lexicographical work such as the *Shuowen Jiezi*. The left margin includes vertical annotations like '大十九' and '沈錫'. The content appears to be etymological entries for bird-related characters, including definitions, phonetic indications (e.g., '切'), and structural components ('从鳥')."}
