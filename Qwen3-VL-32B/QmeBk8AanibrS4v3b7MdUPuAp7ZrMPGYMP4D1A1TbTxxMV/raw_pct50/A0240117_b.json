The text is arranged in vertical columns, written in traditional Chinese characters. It includes various forms of characters (such as ancient scripts), their definitions, phonetic annotations (using *fanqie* method like '陆盈切'), and etymological explanations. The content focuses on characters related to the radical '卜' (divination/fortune-telling). The heading at the top right says: '兆之從橫也凡卜之屬皆从卜 博木切', meaning 'The horizontal and vertical marks of兆; all characters belonging to 卜 are derived from 卜, pronounced as 博木切'. The left margin contains page numbers and possibly section titles ('大十七', '兑文三下', '袁和')."}
