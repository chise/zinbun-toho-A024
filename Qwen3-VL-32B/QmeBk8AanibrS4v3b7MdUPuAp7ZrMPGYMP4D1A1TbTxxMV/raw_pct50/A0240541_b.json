Each character is accompanied by its corresponding radical (部) and number (e.g., '部四百三十五'), indicating its position in a dictionary or lexicon. The characters are neatly inscribed within a bordered frame. On the left margin, there is vertical text reading '大五十二' and '说文上', suggesting this page is from the 'Shuowen Jiezi' (说文解字), a classical Chinese dictionary. At the bottom left, the name '萬松' appears, possibly indicating the publisher or engraver."}
