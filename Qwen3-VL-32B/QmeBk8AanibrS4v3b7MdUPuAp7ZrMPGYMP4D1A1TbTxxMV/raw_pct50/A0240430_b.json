	{"bbox": [176, 259, 930, 849], "type": "text-box", "comment": "This is a rectangular text box containing Chinese characters in an ancient script (likely seal script), arranged in vertical columns. Each character is accompanied by its definition or phonetic transcription in smaller regular script. The text is enclosed within a thick black border, with additional annotations on the left margin (e.g., '大三十三', '说文十二上', '丁山'). This appears to be a page from a classical Chinese dictionary or linguistic work, such as a version of the *Shuowen Jiezi*. The content includes explanations of characters related to hand actions or tools, with etymological notes and pronunciation guides using Middle Chinese rime dictionaries (e.g., '聲苦浪切', '聲古賣切')."}
