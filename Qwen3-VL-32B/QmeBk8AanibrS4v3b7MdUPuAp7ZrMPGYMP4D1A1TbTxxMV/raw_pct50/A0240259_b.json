It displays various Chinese characters in seal script (篆书) along with their explanations, phonetic annotations (using fanqie method), and etymological descriptions. The characters are arranged vertically in columns, typical of classical Chinese texts. Each entry includes the character itself, its definition, and often its structure (radical + phonetic component). The layout is formal and scholarly, with black ink on aged paper, and the left margin contains vertical text indicating section or chapter information ('大三十三' and '说文上下')."}
