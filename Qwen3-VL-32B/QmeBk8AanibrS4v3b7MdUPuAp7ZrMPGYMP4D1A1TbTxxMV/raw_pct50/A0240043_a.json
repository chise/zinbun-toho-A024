The layout includes ancient Chinese characters (likely seal script or a variant) alongside their explanations in regular script. Each entry typically includes the character, its phonetic notation (using *fanqie* method), etymology, and definitions. The right-hand column contains page number and section information: '小四百〇八' (small 408), '說文二下' (Shuowen Volume 2, lower), and '祁三'. The content appears to be part of a systematic analysis of Chinese characters by radical or phonetic components."}
