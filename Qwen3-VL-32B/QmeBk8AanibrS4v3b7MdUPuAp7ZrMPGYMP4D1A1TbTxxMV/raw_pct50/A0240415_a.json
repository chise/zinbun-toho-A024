The text is written vertically in columns from right to left, typical of traditional East Asian manuscripts. The characters are faded but appear to be Chinese or a related script. On the far right margin, there are some small vertical labels or annotations: '六十二', '十三', and '安昌', which may indicate page number, section, or author information. The paper shows signs of age with discoloration and slight wear along the edges."}
