The layout includes columns of characters with their meanings, phonetic readings (using fanqie), and etymological analysis (e.g., '从走' meaning 'from 走', indicating the radical). The right margin contains annotations such as '小三言十三', '說文二十', '三', and '李明', which may indicate volume, chapter, page number, or a collector's mark."}
