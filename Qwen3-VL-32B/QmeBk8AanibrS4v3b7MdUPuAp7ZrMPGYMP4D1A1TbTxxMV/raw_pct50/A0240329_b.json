The layout includes large seal-script characters on the left, followed by smaller explanations in regular script (楷书). The content focuses on characters related to buildings, structures, and spatial concepts (e.g., 广, 廊, 庐, 廠, etc.). The vertical column on the far left contains page numbers and section markers (e.g., '大三十', '总下七下', '周太')."}
