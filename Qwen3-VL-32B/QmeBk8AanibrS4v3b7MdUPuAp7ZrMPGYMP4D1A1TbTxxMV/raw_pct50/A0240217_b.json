The layout includes large characters in seal script (篆书), followed by explanations in regular script (楷书). The text is arranged vertically, reading from right to left. The content discusses the etymology and meanings of Chinese characters derived from the root '出' (to go out, emerge), with detailed phonetic and semantic breakdowns. The section headers '文二 重一' and '文五' indicate divisions within the text."}
