The layout is vertical, typical of traditional Chinese books. The content appears to be from a dictionary or lexicographical work, possibly the *Shuowen Jiezi* (说文解字), given the style and structure. The right margin includes page numbers and section identifiers such as '小四百〇七' (small 407), '說文四上' (Shuowen Volume 4, Upper), and '十九' (19), along with the name '嚴華' (Yan Hua), likely indicating the publisher or editor. Each entry includes the character in seal script, its phonetic pronunciation (in fanqie notation), definition, and etymological analysis."}
