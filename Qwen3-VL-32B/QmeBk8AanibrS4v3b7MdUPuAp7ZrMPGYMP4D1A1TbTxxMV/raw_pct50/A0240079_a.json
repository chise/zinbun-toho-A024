The layout includes large seal script characters on the left, with smaller regular script explanations to their right, including definitions, phonetic readings (in *fanqie* format), and etymological notes. The column headers indicate the section: '足部' (foot radical section), and the page number '十一' (eleven). The text discusses various characters related to the foot radical (足), such as 践, 踩, 蹲, etc., with detailed explanations of their meanings, pronunciation, and composition."}
