Each entry includes the character, its pronunciation (in反切, fanqie), definition, and etymological analysis (e.g., '从目', '从目某声'). The layout is traditional: vertical columns read top to bottom, right to left. The characters are presented in seal script (篆书) form, with accompanying explanations in regular script (楷书). The rightmost column contains page numbers and section identifiers such as '小三百九六' and '言文四上'. The bottom-right corner has the name '楊永', possibly the editor or publisher."}
