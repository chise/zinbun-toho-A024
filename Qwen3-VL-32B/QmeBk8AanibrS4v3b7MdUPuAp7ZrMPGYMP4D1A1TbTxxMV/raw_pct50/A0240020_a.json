The layout includes ancient Chinese characters (including seal script forms), their definitions, phonetic annotations (using *fanqie* method), and structural analyses (e.g., \"从一...\", meaning 'composed of one...'). The characters shown are: 一 (yī, one), 元 (yuán, beginning/origin), 大 (dà, big), 壬 (rén, a Heavenly Stem), and 上 (shàng, above/high). The text explains etymologies and meanings, such as '万物凡一之属皆从一' (All things, all belonging to 'one', follow 'one'), indicating the root character '一' for this section. The bottom right corner notes '楊本' (Yang edition), suggesting this is a specific printed version of the text."}
