The text is arranged in vertical columns from right to left, with characters in seal script (篆书) on the left side of each entry, followed by explanations in regular script (楷书). The main heading '韭' (jiǔ, meaning 'leek') is defined as a vegetable name, with etymological and structural analysis provided. Other entries include related characters like '韯', '蔁', '薋', '䖷', etc., with their meanings, pronunciations (using fanqie method), and structural components. The page number '小一百九十一' (small 191) and other annotations like '景昌' suggest this is part of a larger printed volume."}
