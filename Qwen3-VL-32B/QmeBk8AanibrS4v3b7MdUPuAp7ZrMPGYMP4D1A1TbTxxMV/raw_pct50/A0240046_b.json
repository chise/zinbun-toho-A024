It contains small seal script (小篆) characters arranged in columns, each accompanied by its phonetic notation (in反切), meaning, and sometimes etymological explanation. The left margin includes section information: '左文五十三' (Left Text 53), '重二大篆从屮' (Second Repeated Large Seal Script with radical 屮), and '仲奇' (possibly a name or reference). The main content lists characters related to the radical '屮' (a plant-like radical), such as 芟, 萧, 蒸, 爪, 折, etc., with their definitions and pronunciation guides."}
