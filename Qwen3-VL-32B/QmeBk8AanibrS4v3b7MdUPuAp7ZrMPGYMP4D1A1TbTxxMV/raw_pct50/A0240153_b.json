The layout includes large seal script characters (篆书) on the left side of each entry, followed by their definitions, phonetic readings (using the *fanqie* method), and etymological explanations in regular script (楷书). The entries are arranged vertically, with columns separated by thin lines. The content focuses on characters related to meat or flesh (from the radical 肉, meaning 'meat'), as seen in the structure and definitions. The marginal notes include page numbers or section markers like '大卅三' and '陳玉'. The black border frames the main textual area."}
