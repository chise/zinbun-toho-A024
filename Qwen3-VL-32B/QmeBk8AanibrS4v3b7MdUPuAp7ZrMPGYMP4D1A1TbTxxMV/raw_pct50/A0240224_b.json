The text is arranged in vertical columns, with large characters on the left side (likely the character being defined) followed by smaller explanatory text including definitions, phonetic readings (in *fanqie* notation), etymologies, and component analysis. The characters are presented in seal script (篆书) for the main entries, with explanations in regular script. The page number '六二十九' (629) and section marker '说文下' (Shuowen Xia) appear vertically along the left margin."}
