It displays characters in seal script (篆书) alongside their definitions, etymologies, and phonetic annotations (using the fanqie method). The layout is traditional: vertical columns read top to bottom, right to left. Each entry includes the character, its meaning, components (e.g., '从土' meaning 'from earth'), and pronunciation (e.g., '斯氏切'). The right margin contains page numbers ('小三百十五') and section identifiers ('說文十三上')."}
