The characters are written in black ink on a light background, with larger, stylized forms (possibly seal script or similar) appearing alongside smaller explanatory text in regular script. The layout is typical of traditional Chinese printing, with right-to-left reading order. There are also marginal annotations (e.g., '六十八', '兑文上', '唐文') along the left edge, indicating page or section numbers and possibly textual sources."}
