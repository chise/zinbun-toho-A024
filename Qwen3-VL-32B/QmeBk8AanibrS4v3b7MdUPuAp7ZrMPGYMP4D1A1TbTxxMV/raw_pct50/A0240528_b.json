The text is arranged from right to left, top to bottom, typical of traditional Chinese printing. It includes headings like '五曰摹印', '六曰署書', '七曰殳書', '八曰隸書', and '尉律'. The margin on the left contains smaller vertical text: '大' at the top, followed by '說文十五上', then '四', and finally '仲奇' at the bottom — likely indicating volume, chapter, page number, and publisher or annotator."}
