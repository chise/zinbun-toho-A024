The characters are written in seal script (小篆) on the left side of each entry, with corresponding explanations in regular script (楷书) to the right. Each entry includes the character, its phonetic reading (via *fanqie* system, e.g., '聲胡蠟切'), and etymological or semantic notes (e.g., '地名从邑', meaning 'a place name, composed with the radical 邑'). The text is arranged in columns from right to left, typical of traditional Chinese books. The outer frame has a black border, and there is marginalia on the left edge indicating page or section information ('大二十四', '兌文下', '一六', '嚴振')."}
