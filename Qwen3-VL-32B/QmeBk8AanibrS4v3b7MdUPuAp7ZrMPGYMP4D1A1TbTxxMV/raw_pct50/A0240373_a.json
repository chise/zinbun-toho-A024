The layout includes large seal script characters (篆书) on the left, with corresponding explanations in smaller regular script (楷书) to their right. Each entry provides etymological analysis ('从心' meaning 'from heart radical'), phonetic notation (e.g., '苦叶切', '苦支切'), and definitions. The vertical column on the far right contains page numbers and section titles, such as '小豆九' and '說文十一'. The content focuses on characters related to the '心' (heart) radical, discussing meanings like 'joy', 'sorrow', 'carefulness', 'beauty', and 'thought'. The paper shows signs of age, with slight discoloration and wear along the edges."}
