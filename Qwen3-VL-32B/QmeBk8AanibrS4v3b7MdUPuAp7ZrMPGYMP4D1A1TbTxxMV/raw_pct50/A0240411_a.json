The characters are arranged vertically in columns, with each entry including a large character (possibly in seal script), followed by smaller annotations in regular script providing definitions, phonetic readings (e.g., '聲户賺切'), and etymological notes (e.g., '魚名从魚臽'). The rightmost column contains page numbering ('小三百八') and section headers ('說文十二下', '大王生')."}
