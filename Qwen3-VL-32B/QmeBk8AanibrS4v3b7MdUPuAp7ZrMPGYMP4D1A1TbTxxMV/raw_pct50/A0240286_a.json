It contains entries for characters related to the radical '人' (person), presented in a grid format with each entry including the character itself, its definition, phonetic notation (using *fanqie* method), and sometimes etymological or structural analysis. The rightmost column includes page number information: '小三百九十五' (Small 395) and '言又广上' (indicating section). The characters are rendered in seal script (篆书) alongside standard script (楷书) for definitions and annotations."}
