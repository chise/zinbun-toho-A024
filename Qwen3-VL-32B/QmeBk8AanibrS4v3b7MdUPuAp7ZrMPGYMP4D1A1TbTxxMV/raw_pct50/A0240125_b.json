The layout includes large seal script characters (e.g., 瞻, 瞰, 瞻) on the left, followed by their definitions, phonetic annotations (in反切), and etymological explanations (e.g., '从目', '从目啓'). The text is arranged in vertical columns read from right to left. The margins contain pagination and section markers such as '大三十' and '兌文四上'. The overall content focuses on characters related to vision ('目' radical) and their meanings and pronunciations."}
