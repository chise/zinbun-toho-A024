The layout includes large characters (likely seal script or ancient forms) with smaller annotations in regular script providing definitions, phonetic information (using *fanqie*), and etymological notes (e.g., '从口' meaning 'from 口', indicating semantic components). The content focuses on characters related to the mouth or speech (e.g., 呼, 問, 哭, 笑, etc.)."}
