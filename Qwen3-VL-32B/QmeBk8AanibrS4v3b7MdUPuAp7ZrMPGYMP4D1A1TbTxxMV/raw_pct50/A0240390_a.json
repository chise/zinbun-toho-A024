It appears to be a page from an ancient dictionary or classical text, likely the *Shuowen Jiezi* (说文解字), as indicated by the label '說文十二上' (Shuowen Volume 12, Upper) on the right margin. The content includes definitions, phonetic annotations (using fanqie method), and etymological explanations for water-related characters. The black border frames the entire text area."}
