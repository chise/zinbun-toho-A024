The page displays characters in seal script (篆书) along with their classification by radical ('部') and number. For example, '日部二百三十一' indicates the character '日' is in the '日' radical group, entry 231. The layout includes columns of characters with accompanying annotations indicating their radical and sequence number. The right margin contains additional metadata such as '小二百四十九' (small 249), likely a pagination or section marker, and '嚴華', possibly a publisher or annotator's name."}
