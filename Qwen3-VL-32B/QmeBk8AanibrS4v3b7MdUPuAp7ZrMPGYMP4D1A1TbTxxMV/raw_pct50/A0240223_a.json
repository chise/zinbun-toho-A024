	{"bbox": [70, 254, 893, 858], "type": "text-box", "comment": "This is a rectangular text box containing Chinese characters in an ancient script (likely seal script or similar), arranged in vertical columns. The characters are accompanied by annotations in smaller regular script, providing definitions, phonetic guides (e.g., '切' indicating pronunciation), and etymological notes (e.g., '从貝' meaning 'from 貝'). The right edge of the box has some ink smudging or damage, possibly from the binding or aging. The content appears to be from a classical Chinese dictionary or lexicographical work, such as the *Shuowen Jiezi* or a similar text, focusing on characters related to the radical '貝' (shell/money)."}
