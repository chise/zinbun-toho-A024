The box is bordered in black ink, with some smudging or ink bleed visible along the right edge. There are faint traces of characters within the columns, but they are mostly illegible due to fading or overwriting. In the upper-right corner, there is a small vertical column with legible characters: '小六' (xiǎo liù) and '下' (xià), possibly indicating a page number or section marker. The overall condition suggests age or wear."}
