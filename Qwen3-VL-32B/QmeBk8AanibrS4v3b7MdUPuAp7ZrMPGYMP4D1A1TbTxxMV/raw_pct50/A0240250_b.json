The text is arranged in vertical columns, written in traditional Chinese characters, with each entry including a large seal script character followed by its definition, phonetic notation (using *fanqie*), and etymological analysis (often including components like '从禾' meaning 'from 禾'). The content focuses on characters related to '禾' (grain/seed), as seen in the repeated component and explanations. The page appears to be from an old printed book, with visible ink smudges along the left margin, possibly from binding or handling."}
