Each large character is followed by its pronunciation in '反切' (fanqie) notation (e.g., '鸡切', '喜虚里切'), which indicates phonetic transcription using two Chinese characters — the first gives the initial consonant, the second the final vowel and tone. The characters are arranged in columns, with smaller annotations below each. The right margin includes page numbering ('小二百四') and possibly a section identifier ('杨永')."}
