The layout includes large characters in seal script (篆书) on the left, with smaller explanatory text in regular script (楷书) to their right, including definitions, phonetic annotations (using *fanqie*), and etymological breakdowns (e.g., '从日' meaning 'from 日'). The content focuses on characters related to the radical '日' (sun/day)."}
