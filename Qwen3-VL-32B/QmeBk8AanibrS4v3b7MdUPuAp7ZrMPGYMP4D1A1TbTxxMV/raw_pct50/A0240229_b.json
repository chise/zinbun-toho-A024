	{"bbox": [165, 257, 934, 867], "type": "text-box", "comment": "This is a rectangular text box containing ancient Chinese characters in seal script (篆书), arranged vertically in columns. Each character is accompanied by its phonetic pronunciation (in '反切' format) and etymological or semantic explanation (e.g., '地名从邑', '声书沼切'). The layout follows traditional Chinese book formatting: right-to-left reading order, vertical columns, with annotations to the right of each main character. The box has a thick black border. On the left margin, there are additional vertical annotations including page number ('大二十九') and other metadata ('说文下下', '陈寅')."}
