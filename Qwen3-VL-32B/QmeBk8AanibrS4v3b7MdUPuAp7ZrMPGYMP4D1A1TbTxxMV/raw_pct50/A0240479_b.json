The layout features large seal script (小篆) characters on the left side of each entry, followed by their explanations in regular script (楷书), including definitions, phonetic information (using *fanqie* method), and etymological components (e.g., '从土' meaning 'composed of 土'). The content focuses on characters related to 'earth' (土). The vertical column on the far left contains marginal notes such as '大艸' (likely indicating a section header), '兌之下三下', and '七 蔣安' (possibly a page number or annotator's name)."}
