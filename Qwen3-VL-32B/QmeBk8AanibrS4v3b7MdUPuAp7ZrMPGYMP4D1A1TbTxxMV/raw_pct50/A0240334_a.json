	{"bbox": [74, 245, 893, 860], "type": "text-box", "comment": "This is a rectangular text box containing Chinese characters in vertical columns, typical of classical Chinese texts. The characters are written in a formal script (likely seal script or clerical script) with accompanying phonetic annotations (反切) and definitions. The layout includes large characters on the left, followed by smaller explanatory text to their right. The box is bordered by a thick black frame, and there are marginal notes along the right edge. The content appears to be from a dictionary or lexicon, possibly related to the *Shuowen Jiezi* or similar classical work, given the structure and style."}
