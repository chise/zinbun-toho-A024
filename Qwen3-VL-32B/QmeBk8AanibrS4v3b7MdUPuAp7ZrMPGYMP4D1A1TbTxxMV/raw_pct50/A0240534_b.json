	{"bbox": [165, 250, 934, 855], "type": "text-box", "comment": "This is a rectangular text box containing Chinese characters in seal script (篆书), arranged vertically in columns. The main heading reads '说文解字第四建' (Shuowen Jiezi Di Si Jian), indicating this is the fourth section of the Shuowen Jiezi, a classical Chinese dictionary. Each character is accompanied by its radical (部) and a numerical index (e.g., 部一百一, meaning 'Radical 101'). The layout includes a thick black border around the entire block, with smaller annotations on the left margin such as '大四十六' and '沈三', possibly indicating page or volume numbers. The text is printed in black ink on aged paper, typical of traditional Chinese woodblock prints."}
