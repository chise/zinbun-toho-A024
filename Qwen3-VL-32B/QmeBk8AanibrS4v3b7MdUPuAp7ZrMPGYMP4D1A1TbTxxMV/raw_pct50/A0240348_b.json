It contains entries for various dog-related characters (all with the radical '犬' meaning 'dog'), each with their ancient script forms, definitions, phonetic readings (using the 'fanqie' method), and etymological explanations. The layout includes large characters on the left, followed by smaller explanatory text to the right. The vertical column on the far left contains pagination or section markers ('大廿七', '兑之二二', etc.)."}
