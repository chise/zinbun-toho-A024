The text includes large characters (likely the headwords), followed by smaller explanatory text including definitions, phonetic information (e.g., '切'), and etymological notes. The layout is traditional Chinese book format, with right-to-left reading order. There are also side annotations such as '文二' (two characters), '新附' (newly added), and page/section markers like '六十五' and '说文上'. The left margin shows partial visible text from the previous page ('说文上')."}
