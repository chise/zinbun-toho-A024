	{"bbox": [159, 263, 908, 857], "type": "text-box", "comment": "This is a rectangular text box containing Chinese characters in a traditional vertical layout, likely from a classical dictionary or linguistic text. The characters are arranged in columns from right to left, with each entry including a character, its pronunciation (in '反切' format), and etymological or semantic explanation. The outer border is thick and black, emphasizing the content as a distinct block. The text appears to be in seal script or a similar ancient style, suggesting this is a page from a historical linguistic work such as the *Shuowen Jiezi*. The left margin contains additional annotations or page numbers in smaller print."}
