Each character is accompanied by its definition, phonetic notation (using fanqie), and etymological components (e.g., '从走', '从尸'). The text appears to be from a classical Chinese dictionary or lexicographical work, possibly the *Shuowen Jiezi* or a similar source. The black border frames the entire text area, and there are marginal notes on the left edge indicating page or section information ('大三十七', '完下', '焦克')."}
