The layout features large characters in seal script (篆书) on the left, with their explanations and phonetic annotations in smaller regular script (楷书) to the right. The content focuses on characters related to '白' (bái, white), including its meaning, etymology, and associated characters. The text includes definitions such as '西方色也' (the color of the west) and '陰用事物色白' (the color white used for yin things). The section is titled '文二' (Second Character), indicating it's part of a larger categorization system. The vertical margin notes include '小三百十六' (small 3016) and '吳明' (Wu Ming), possibly a page number and printer/publisher name."}
