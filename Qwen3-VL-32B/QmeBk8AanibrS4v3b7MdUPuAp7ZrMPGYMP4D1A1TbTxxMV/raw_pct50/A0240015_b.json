The characters are arranged in vertical columns from right to left, typical of traditional Chinese texts. The outer border is a thick black frame. In the upper-left corner, there is a small vertical label reading '大五十二' (Dà Wǔshí'èr), likely indicating a page or section number. At the bottom-left corner, the name '程樹' (Chéng Shù) appears, possibly the author or engraver. The paper shows signs of age, with slight discoloration and ink bleed along the left margin."}
