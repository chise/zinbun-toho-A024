The main content consists of large, stylized characters in seal script (篆书) with accompanying explanations in regular script (楷书 or similar). Each entry includes the character, its pronunciation (using fanqie method, e.g., '直刃切'), meaning, etymology, and sometimes references to classical texts like the *Book of Documents* (周书) or *Book of Songs* (诗). The layout is traditional, with characters arranged vertically and read right-to-left. The text appears to be printed using woodblock printing, typical of early Chinese books."}
