The layout includes large characters (likely seal script or a stylized form) on the left, with smaller explanatory text in regular script to their right. Each entry provides definitions, phonetic annotations (using *fanqie* method), etymological analysis (e.g., '从火' meaning 'composed of fire radical'), and sometimes citations from classical texts (e.g., '诗曰', '书曰'). The content focuses on characters related to fire (火部). The vertical column on the far left contains page numbers or section markers: '说文十二' (Shuowen Volume 12), '上五' (Upper Five), and '丁山'. The paper shows signs of age, with some discoloration and wear along the edges."}
