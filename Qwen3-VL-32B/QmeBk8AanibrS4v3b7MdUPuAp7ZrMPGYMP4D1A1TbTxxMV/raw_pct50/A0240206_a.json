It displays characters in seal script (小篆) alongside their definitions, phonetic readings (using the fanqie method), and etymological explanations. The content focuses on characters related to wood or wooden structures (木部), such as 柱 (pillar), 栋 (beam), 楹 (doorpost), etc., with detailed descriptions of their forms, meanings, and usage. The layout includes columns of characters with annotations to the right. The top-right corner contains the label '小字大' and '說文二一', indicating this is page 21 of a section titled 'Small Characters Large'. The text is vertically aligned, typical of classical Chinese books."}
