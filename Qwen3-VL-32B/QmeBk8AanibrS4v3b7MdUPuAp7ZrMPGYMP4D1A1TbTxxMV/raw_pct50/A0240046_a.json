	{"bbox": [75, 248, 869, 860], "type": "text-box", "comment": "This is a rectangular text box containing Chinese characters in seal script (small seal script) with accompanying annotations in regular script. The text is arranged vertically from right to left, typical of classical Chinese texts. It appears to be a page from an ancient dictionary or linguistic work, such as the *Shuowen Jiezi*, which explains the origins and meanings of Chinese characters. The black border frames the content neatly, and there are marginal notes on the right side indicating section numbers (e.g., '小三百六九', '說文二十')."}
