The layout features large **seal script** (篆书) characters in the center, with smaller **regular script** (楷书) annotations to their right, providing definitions, phonetic readings (via *fanqie*), etymologies, and compound structures. The content focuses on characters related to '车' (vehicle/wheel), as seen in entries like 车、轫、轭、辕、轴, etc. The vertical column on the far left includes marginal notes such as '大廿九' (page number), '说文三下' (volume/section), and '陈玉' (possibly a collector's or publisher's mark)."}
