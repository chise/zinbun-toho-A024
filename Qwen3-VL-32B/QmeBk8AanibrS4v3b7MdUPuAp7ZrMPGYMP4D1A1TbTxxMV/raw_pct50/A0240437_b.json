It contains entries for various Chinese characters with their meanings, phonetic annotations (in fanqie), and etymological explanations. The characters are written in seal script (篆书) alongside their standard forms and definitions. The layout is vertical, typical of classical Chinese texts. The left margin includes pagination or section markers: '大廿八' (Da Erba, meaning 'Big Twenty-Eight'), '兑文二十二' (Dui Wen Er Shi Er), '五', and '唐文'. The content focuses on female-related characters (all containing the radical 女, 'woman'), such as 婢, 嬛, 嫦, 姝, 妖, 妒, etc., with detailed explanations of their meanings and pronunciations."}
