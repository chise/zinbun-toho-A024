The text includes both large characters and smaller annotations (likely phonetic or explanatory notes). The heading reads '說文解字第十四' (Shuowen Jiezi, Volume 14), indicating this is from the classic Chinese dictionary Shuowen Jiezi. The layout is typical of traditional Chinese printed texts, with characters read top to bottom and right to left. The border is thick and black, emphasizing the content within."}
