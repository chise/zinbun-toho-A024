The layout features large characters in seal script (篆书) on the left side of each entry, with smaller regular script (楷书) explanations to their right. Each entry includes the character’s definition, phonetic notation (using *fanqie* method), and etymological components (e.g., '从木' meaning 'from wood'). The characters are arranged vertically in columns, reading from top to bottom and right to left. The black border frames the content, and marginal notes on the left edge include page numbers or section markers ('大廿八', '陈五', etc.)."}
