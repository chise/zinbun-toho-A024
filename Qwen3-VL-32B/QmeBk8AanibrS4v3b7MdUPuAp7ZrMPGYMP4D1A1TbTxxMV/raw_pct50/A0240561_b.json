The text is written in traditional vertical format, read from right to left. Each column contains annotations or corrections, including references to '叶' (page/leaf) and '行' (line), such as '十七叶六行' (page 17, line 6). There are also notes about character changes, e.g., '后改' (later changed to), and discussions of different script forms like '篆文' (seal script), '古文' (ancient script), and '籀文' (Zhou script). The left margin includes page numbers ('大九') and other marginalia, possibly indicating ownership or editorial notes ('陳生')."}
