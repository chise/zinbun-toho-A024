The text is arranged in columns, with each entry containing a character (in seal script), its definition, pronunciation (via fanqie method), and etymological analysis. The characters are written in black ink on white paper, with a thick black border framing the main content. The right margin contains small annotations such as '小1784' and '十二', possibly indicating page number or section. The bottom right corner has the mark '繆春', likely the name of the publisher or scribe."}
