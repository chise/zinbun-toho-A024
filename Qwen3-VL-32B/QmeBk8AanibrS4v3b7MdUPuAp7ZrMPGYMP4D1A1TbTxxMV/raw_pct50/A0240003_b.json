The characters are enclosed within a thick black rectangular border. The overall layout suggests this is likely a title or cover of a classical Chinese text, possibly a version or edition of the 'Shuowen Jiezi' (说文解字), an ancient Chinese dictionary. The paper appears aged, with slight discoloration and texture visible around the edges."}
