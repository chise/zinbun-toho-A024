The text is arranged in columns from right to left, typical of classical Chinese books. It includes large characters (likely headers or entries) with smaller annotations below them, including phonetic readings (e.g., '切'), definitions, and structural explanations (e.g., '从哭', '从天'). The content appears to be from a dictionary or lexicographical work such as the *Shuowen Jiezi*. There are also marginalia on the left edge, possibly page numbers or section markers ('六十二', '上三', etc.)."}
