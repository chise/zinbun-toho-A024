The layout includes large characters in seal script (小篆) on the left, with explanations in regular script to their right. Each entry provides definitions, phonetic information (using fanqie, e.g., '慈吕切'), and etymological notes ('从口' meaning 'from 口', indicating semantic component). The vertical column on the far right contains page numbers and section headings: '小三页十二' (page 12 of section 3), '言文二' (section 2 of the 'Yan' category), and '任三' (possibly a volume or section marker)."}
