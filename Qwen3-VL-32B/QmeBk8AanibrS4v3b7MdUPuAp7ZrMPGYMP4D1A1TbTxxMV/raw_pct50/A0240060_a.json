The text is arranged in vertical columns, with each entry containing a Chinese character (often in seal script), its definition, phonetic information (using *fanqie* method), and sometimes etymological notes. The characters are presented in a traditional format: large seal script forms on the left, followed by explanations in regular script to the right. The page number '小三百十五' (Small 300-15) and section '言文二一' (Speech Text 21) appear at the top right, along with the name '嚴華' (Yan Hua) at the bottom right, possibly indicating the publisher or editor. The content focuses on characters related to speech, sound, and vocal expressions (e.g., 嗷, 吟, 喋, 嘆)."}
