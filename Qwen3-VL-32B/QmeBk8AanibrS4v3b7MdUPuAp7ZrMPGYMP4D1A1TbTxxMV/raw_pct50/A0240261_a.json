The content consists of entries for various Chinese characters, each accompanied by their ancient forms (often in seal script), definitions, phonetic annotations (using fanqie method), and etymological explanations. The layout is traditional: characters are arranged vertically, with explanations to their right. The page includes characters such as 宿 (xù, meaning 'to stay overnight'), 寓 (yù, meaning 'to reside'), 寄 (jì, meaning 'to entrust'), 寅 (yín, a zodiac sign), etc., along with their components, meanings, and pronunciations. The marginalia on the right indicates '三百一' (301) and '祁三', possibly denoting page number or section. The overall style suggests an old printed edition, possibly woodblock-printed."}
