The text is arranged in vertical columns, reading right to left. Each entry includes the character in seal script, its meaning, component analysis (e.g., '从宀' meaning 'from 宀'), and pronunciation via *fanqie*. The page number '小三百八十二' (Small 382) appears at the top right, and there are marginal notes such as '任三'. The content focuses on characters related to the radical '宀' (roof/cover), including 安, 寅, 密, 寂, 寔, 富, etc."}
