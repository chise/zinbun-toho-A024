Each entry includes the character in seal script, its pronunciation (in fanqie notation), definition, and etymological analysis (e.g., '从足某声' meaning 'composed of 足 and 某 as phonetic'). The layout is vertical, with columns reading right to left. The black border frames the main content. Marginal notes on the left include '大卅三', '兑文二', '上三', and '柔和', which may indicate volume, section, or page number."}
