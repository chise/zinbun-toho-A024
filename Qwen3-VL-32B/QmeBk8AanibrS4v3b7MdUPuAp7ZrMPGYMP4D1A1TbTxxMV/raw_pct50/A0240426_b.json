The text includes both small regular script (likely explanatory text or definitions) and larger, stylized characters (possibly seal script or another classical form), likely from a dictionary or lexicon such as the *Shuowen Jiezi*. The layout features black borders around the text area, with annotations on the left margin indicating section headings or page numbers ('大卅', '兌文二十二', '十三', '唐文')."}
