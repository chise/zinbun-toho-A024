The text contains entries for characters related to the radical '耳' (ear), with each entry showing the character in seal script, its pronunciation (in fanqie notation), definition, and etymological analysis. The layout includes columns with characters on the left and their explanations on the right. The top-right corner indicates '小月卅一' and '說文十三', suggesting this is page 31 of volume 13 of a small-format edition of the *Shuowen*. The name '李云' appears at the bottom right, possibly indicating the editor or publisher."}
