The layout features large characters in seal script (篆书) on the left, with corresponding explanations in smaller regular script (楷书) to their right. Each entry includes definitions, phonetic annotations (using the 'fanqie' method), and etymological or structural notes. The content focuses on characters related to the radical 黑 (black). The vertical column on the far left contains marginalia, including section markers such as “大廿一” (Da Er Shi Yi, meaning 'Section Twenty-One') and “上” (Upper), indicating this is part of a larger structured text. The bottom-left corner shows the name “陳玉”, possibly the publisher or scribe. The entire text block is framed by a thick black border."}
