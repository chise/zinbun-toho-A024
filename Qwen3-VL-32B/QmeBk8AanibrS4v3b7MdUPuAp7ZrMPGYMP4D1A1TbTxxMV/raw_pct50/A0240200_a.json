The text includes both large characters and smaller annotations, typical of classical Chinese dictionaries or linguistic texts such as the *Shuowen Jiezi*. The box has a thick black border on three sides (top, left, bottom) and appears to be part of a printed page from an old book. The right edge shows some ink smudging or wear, possibly due to aging or printing imperfections."}
