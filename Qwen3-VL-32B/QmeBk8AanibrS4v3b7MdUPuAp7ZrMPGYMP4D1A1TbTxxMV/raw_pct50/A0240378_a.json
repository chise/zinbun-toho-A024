Each entry includes a large seal script character, followed by its definition, phonetic notation (using '切' - qie, meaning 'cut' or 'pronunciation guide'), and etymological components (e.g., '从心', meaning 'from heart'). The text is enclosed within a thick black border. On the right margin, there are additional annotations: '小二五九一', '說文十一', '十三', and '李云', which likely indicate page number, volume, section, and possibly a compiler or annotator's name."}
