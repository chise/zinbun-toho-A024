The layout is vertical, typical of traditional Chinese texts, with characters arranged in columns from right to left. Each entry includes the character, its meaning, pronunciation (via fanqie), and sometimes structural analysis (e.g., '从广' indicating the radical or component). The right margin contains page numbering ('小三百十七') and other metadata ('說文七十一', '李明')."}
