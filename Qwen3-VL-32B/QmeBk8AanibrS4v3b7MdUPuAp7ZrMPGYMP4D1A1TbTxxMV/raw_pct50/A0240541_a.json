The characters are written in seal script (篆书), arranged vertically in columns. Each character is followed by its department (部) number (e.g., 部四百 for 'Department 400') and a sequential number (e.g., 十四 for 14). The right margin contains additional annotations including page numbers (小二百五十八) and possibly publisher or edition details (嚴華)."}
