The text is arranged in vertical columns, reading from right to left, with large characters (likely the main entries) followed by smaller explanatory text. The content includes definitions, phonetic notations (e.g., '切'), etymological explanations ('从...'), and references to character components ('凡...之屬'). The layout includes decorative borders and marginal notes, such as '大十' and '沈錫', indicating volume or section number and possibly a publisher or annotator's name."}
