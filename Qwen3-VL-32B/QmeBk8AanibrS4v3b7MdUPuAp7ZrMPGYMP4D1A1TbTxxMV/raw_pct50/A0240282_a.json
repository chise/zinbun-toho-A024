	{"bbox": [74, 250, 843, 859], "type": "text-box", "comment": "This is a rectangular text box containing classical Chinese characters in seal script (篆书) and accompanying annotations in regular script. The layout is vertical, typical of traditional Chinese texts. The content appears to be from a dictionary or linguistic work, possibly the *Shuowen Jiezi* or a similar character etymology text, with each entry including the character, its pronunciation (in fanqie notation), and explanation of its meaning and structure (e.g., '从人' meaning 'from person'). The right margin contains page numbers and section markers ('小三百八十四', '讖文八上', '五 十武')."}
