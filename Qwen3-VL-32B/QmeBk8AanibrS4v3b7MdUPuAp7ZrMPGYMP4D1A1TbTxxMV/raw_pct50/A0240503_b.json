The layout features large seal script characters (篆书) in the center, each accompanied by its phonetic transcription (using fanqie method), definition, and etymological explanation (often including radical components and semantic categorization). The text is arranged vertically, read from right to left. The left margin contains pagination and section information: '大冊二' (Volume 2), '兑文上' (Upper part of the 'Dui' section), '十四' (Page 14), and '顧恩' (possibly the name of the editor or publisher). The content focuses on characters related to the '車' (vehicle/cart) radical, as indicated by the recurring component '从車' (from 車) in definitions."}
