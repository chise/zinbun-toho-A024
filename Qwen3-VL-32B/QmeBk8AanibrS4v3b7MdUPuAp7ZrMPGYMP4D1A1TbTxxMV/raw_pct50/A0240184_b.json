The text is arranged in vertical columns, with large characters (likely seal script) on the left and smaller explanatory text (in regular script) to their right. The content includes definitions, phonetic annotations (e.g., '切', '聲'), and etymological notes ('从...', '古文'). The box is bordered by a thick black frame, typical of traditional Chinese printed books."}
