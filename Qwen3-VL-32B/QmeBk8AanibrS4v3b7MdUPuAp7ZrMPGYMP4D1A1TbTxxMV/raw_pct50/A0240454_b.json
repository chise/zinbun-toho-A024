The layout includes large characters in seal script (篆书) on the left side of each entry, followed by their definitions and phonetic annotations in regular script. The vertical columns contain explanations including meanings, component analysis (e.g., '从糸' meaning 'from thread'), and pronunciation via fanqie (反切). The marginalia indicates the source as '大典' (Da Dian) and '说文十三上' (Shuowen Chapter 13, Upper), suggesting it's part of a larger annotated edition. The bottom margin notes '唐文', possibly indicating Tang dynasty-style transcription or annotation."}
