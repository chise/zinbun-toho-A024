It contains entries for various characters related to '鼠' (rat/mouse), presented in small seal script (小篆) with explanations in regular script. Each entry includes the character, its pronunciation (via *fanqie* method), meaning, and sometimes etymological or structural analysis. The layout is traditional: vertical columns read from right to left, with each row containing a character, its definition, and phonetic notation. The side margin shows page numbers and section titles (e.g., '大十九', '說文上二', '袁和')."}
