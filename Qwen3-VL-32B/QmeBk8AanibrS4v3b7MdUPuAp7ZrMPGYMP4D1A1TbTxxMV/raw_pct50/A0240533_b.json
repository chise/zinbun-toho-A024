The content consists of large characters written in seal script (篆书), each accompanied by smaller annotations indicating their radical (部) and stroke count (如“部四”、“十”等). The layout is grid-like with vertical columns. The left margin contains additional markings such as '大五十二', '沈占', and other partial text, possibly indicating page numbers or editorial notes. The overall style suggests a traditional woodblock print or early printed edition."}
