The layout is vertical, typical of traditional Chinese books. Each entry includes a character in large seal script, followed by its explanation (including etymology, phonetic components, and definitions), often with references to ancient forms or variants (e.g., '古文', '籀文'). The text is organized in columns from right to left, consistent with classical Chinese printing conventions. The outer border is thick and black, framing the content clearly."}
