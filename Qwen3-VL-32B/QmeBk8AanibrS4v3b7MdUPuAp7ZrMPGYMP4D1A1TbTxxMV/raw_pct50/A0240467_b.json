The text is arranged in vertical columns from right to left, with each entry consisting of a character in seal script, followed by its definition, phonetic notation (using '切' - cutting method), and etymological components ('从...'). The left margin contains pagination or section identifiers: '大廿七' (Da Er Qi, possibly a chapter/section number), '说文十三上' (Shuowen Chapter 13, Upper), '十五' (fifteen, likely page number), and '王生' (Wang Sheng, possibly a name or printer's mark)."}
