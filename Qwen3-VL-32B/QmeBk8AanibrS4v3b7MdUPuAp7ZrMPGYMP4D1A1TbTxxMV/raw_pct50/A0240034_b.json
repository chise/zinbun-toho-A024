Each character is accompanied by its definition or phonetic explanation in smaller regular script. The box has a thick black border and appears to be from a classical Chinese dictionary or lexicon, such as the *Shuowen Jiezi*. The text is organized into multiple vertical columns, with each entry consisting of a large character followed by its etymology or pronunciation note. The left margin contains page numbers and possibly section identifiers ('大三十一', '完文二下', '三一', '沈占')."}
