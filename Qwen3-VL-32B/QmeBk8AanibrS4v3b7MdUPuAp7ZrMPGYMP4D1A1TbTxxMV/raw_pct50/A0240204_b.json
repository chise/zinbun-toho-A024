It displays characters in seal script (小篆) alongside their definitions, phonetic information (using反切), and etymological components (e.g., '从木' meaning 'from wood'). The layout includes vertical columns of characters with explanations to their right. The left margin contains annotations such as '大卅二' and '兑文上', indicating section or page numbering. The bottom-left corner has '唐根', possibly a publisher or collector's mark."}
