The layout includes small seal script characters on the left with corresponding explanations in regular script to their right. The content appears to be definitions of characters related to '糸' (silk/thread), including phonetic transcriptions (e.g., '切', '聲') and semantic descriptions. Marginal notes include '大卅三' and '說文上十三', indicating volume/page information, and '蔣安' at the bottom, possibly a collector's mark or publisher's name."}
