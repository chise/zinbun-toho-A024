It displays characters in seal script (小篆) along with their definitions, phonetic annotations (using fanqie), and structural components (e.g., '从木' meaning 'from wood'). The main heading indicates '文四百二十一 重三十九' (421 original characters, 39 duplicates). The left margin includes '文十一 新附', suggesting this is part of a new appendix section. The right margin contains vertical annotations like '小言' and '十之'. The text is arranged vertically, read from top to bottom and right to left, typical of traditional Chinese printing."}
