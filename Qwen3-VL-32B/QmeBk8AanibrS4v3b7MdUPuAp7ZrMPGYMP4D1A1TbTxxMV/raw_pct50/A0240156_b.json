The text includes both large characters (possibly the main entries) and smaller annotations (likely definitions, phonetic guides, or etymologies). The layout is typical of classical Chinese dictionaries or lexicographical works such as the *Shuowen Jiezi*. The box is bordered by a thick black frame, and there are marginal notes on the left side, including page numbers and possibly author or edition information."}
