The layout is traditional, with characters arranged from right to left and top to bottom. The text appears to be from a classical Chinese dictionary or lexicon, possibly the *Shuowen Jiezi* or similar work, given the inclusion of character etymologies, phonetic annotations (e.g., '苦浩切'), and definitions."}
