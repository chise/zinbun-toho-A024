The characters are presented in seal script (小篆, xiǎozhuàn), with each character accompanied by its pronunciation (in fanqie notation) and sometimes a brief definition or etymology. The title '說文解字第十' indicates this is the tenth section of the work. The layout is grid-based, typical of traditional Chinese printing, with characters arranged vertically and read from top to bottom, right to left."}
