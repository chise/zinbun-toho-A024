The characters are written in seal script (篆书) style, with accompanying phonetic annotations (反切) in regular script (楷书). The title '說文解字第三' is centered at the top. The box is bordered by a thick black frame. On the left margin, there are vertical annotations including '大五十' and '張信'. The content appears to be from an ancient Chinese dictionary or character compendium, likely a page from a printed edition of *Shuowen Jiezi* (说文解字), specifically Volume 3."}
