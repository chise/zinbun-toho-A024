The layout includes large characters in seal script (篆书) on the left side of each entry, followed by their definitions, phonetic annotations (using the '反切' method), and etymological explanations in regular script (楷书). The content focuses on characters related to trees and plants (木部), as indicated by the recurring radical '木'. The vertical column on the far left contains section headings such as '大卅二' (Section 32), '兑文六上' (Sixth Upper Section of Dui), and '文根' (Root Characters), suggesting this is part of a structured, systematic arrangement of Chinese characters by radical and meaning."}
