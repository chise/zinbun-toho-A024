The text is arranged in columns, with each entry consisting of a character in seal script (篆书), followed by its definition, phonetic transcription (using fanqie method), and sometimes alternative forms or etymological notes. The heading at the top right reads '頁之屬皆从頁首者，諸首字也' (All characters belonging to the '頁' category are those whose heads are from '頁'; these are various head characters), indicating this section covers characters related to the radical '頁' (meaning 'head' or 'page'). The layout includes both small seal script and standard script, with annotations explaining the meaning and pronunciation. The page number '小巻五' (Small Volume Five) and other marginalia suggest it is part of a larger multi-volume work."}
