The text appears to be from a dictionary or lexicon, likely the *Shuowen Jiezi* or a similar work, given the format: each entry includes a character in seal script, its phonetic pronunciation (via反切), etymology (from which radicals or components), and definition. The layout is vertical, read right to left, as traditional Chinese texts are. The black border frames the entire block of text."}
