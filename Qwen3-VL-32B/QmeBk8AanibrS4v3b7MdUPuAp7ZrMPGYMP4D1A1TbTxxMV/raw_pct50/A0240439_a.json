It displays entries for various Chinese characters with their ancient forms (likely seal script), pronunciation (using Middle Chinese rime dictionaries like *Guangyun* or *Pingshui*), definitions, and etymological explanations. The layout follows traditional vertical columns read from right to left. Each entry includes: the character in seal script, its modern form (in some cases), phonetic notation (e.g., '切' - qie, indicating pronunciation via reverse cut method), definition, and sometimes etymology (e.g., '从女...' meaning 'composed of 女...'). The column on the far right contains page numbers ('小四百八') and section markers ('說文十三'). The text is printed in black ink on aged paper, with a thick black border framing the content."}
