The characters appear to be in seal script or a similar ancient style, with accompanying small annotations (likely phonetic or etymological notes) in regular script. The text is enclosed within a thick black border, typical of classical Chinese dictionaries or lexicographical works such as the *Shuowen Jiezi*. The left margin includes vertical column headers like '大字六', '兌文一下', '上二', and '程生', indicating page or section identifiers."}
